\subsection{Particle Identification}
  After the particle tracks are reconstructed, we use a predictive model to
  classify proton tracks. The inputs to the model are the reconstructed
  physical variables, and the output is the probability that the track is from
  a proton vs. some other particle. There are many predictive models that we
  can use, each with advantages and disadvantages. We chose gradient-boosted
  decision trees for a few main reasons: they are easily interpretable, the
  inputs can be a mix of numeric and categorical variables, and boosted
  decision trees perform well at identifying a small signal in a large
  background.  Each tree is essentially a series of cuts based on physical
  variables which have been fine-tuned to increase the efficiency and purity of
  the final selected sample.
  \subsubsection{Reconstructed track features}\label{sec:features}
    The reconstructed features that are used as input to the classifier are
    listed below. Most of the features come directly from the track object, but
    some are created for this classifier. Each of the features used to identify
    protons either helps to separate neutrino-induced tracks from
    cosmic-induced tracks or to separate neutrino-induced proton tracks from
    other neutrino-induced particle types. For colorimetric information we only
    use information from the collection plane.

    Below is a list and description of the features designed to separate
    neutrino-induced protons from other neutrino-induced particle types.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Number of hits:} This is the total number of hits on the
      collection plane that are associated with track. When used in combination
      with track length and average energy deposited, this feature can be used
      to determine the hit and energy density of the track.
      \item \textbf{Straightness:} This is the ratio of distance between
      reconstructed end points (displacement) to reconstructed path length. It
      represents the amount of scattering a track undergoes. The value is
      always between zero and one with one being perfectly straight.
      \item \textbf{Cosmic score:} This is the geometry tagging cosmic score
      from Sec.~\ref{sec:tpcreco}. Tracks with a cosmic score of 1 have already
      been removed in the cosmic hit removal stage. So, this value is either 0
      (fully contained within the TPC) or 0.5 (entering or exiting the TPC).
      \item \textbf{Length:} This is the reconstructed 3D track length found by
      stepping along the trajectory points.
      \item \textbf{Start dE/dx:} This is the total energy deposited on the
      collection plane in the first six non-zero hits along the track divided
      by the distance between hits to account for the angle with respect to the
      wire plane.
      \item \textbf{End to start dE/dx ratio:} This is the ratio of the total
      $dE/dx$ from the last six non-zero hits along the track on the collection
      plane to the total $dE/dx$ from the first six non-zero hits along the
      track on the collection plane.
      \item \textbf{Truncated total dE/dx:} This is the sum of the $dE/dx$ of a
      truncated set of hits on the collection plane associated with track. The
      truncated set includes all hits along the track with a $dE/dx$ value
      within one standard deviation of the median $dE/dx$ value of all hits
      along the track on the collection plane.
      \item \textbf{Truncated average dE/dx:} This is the truncated total
      $dE/dx$ divided by the number of hits in the truncated hit set associated
      with track.
    \end{itemize}

    Next is the list and description of the features designed to separate
    neutrino-induced tracks from cosmic-induced tracks.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Start and end positions:} These are the reconstructed x, y,
      and z positions of start and end of the track. Tracks that start closer
      to a TPC boundary are more likely to be cosmic-induced.
      \item \textbf{$\theta$ and $\phi$:} These are the reconstructed polar and
      azimuthal angles with respect to the beam direction. Vertical tracks are
      much more likely to be cosmic-induced, while forward-going tracks are
      more likely to be from the neutrino beam.
    \end{itemize}
   
    Determining which end of a track is the beginning is difficult when a
    vertex is not observable. Since we are particularly interested in
    neutral-current elastic events with only a single proton, the direction of
    the track is a concern. A proton will deposit much more energy at the end
    of its track than at the beginning which can be used to determine the true
    direction. Since this correction is not currently implemented within the
    reconstruction, we take all reconstructed tracks that have a higher
    deposited energy at the beginning of the track than at the end of the track
    and flip them. The deposited energy at the beginning (ending) of the track
    is defined as the total $dE/dx$ of the first (last) six non-zero hits along
    the track on the collection plane.  This includes changing the saved start
    positions, end positions, $\theta$, $\phi$, start $dE/dx$, end $dE/dx$, and
    the end to start $dE/dx$ ratio.
    
  \subsubsection{Boosted decision trees}\label{sec:decisiontrees}
    A decision tree can be thought of as a series of if/else statements that
    separate a data set into two or more classes as illustrated in
    Fig.~\ref{fig:dtree}. At each node of the tree, a split is chosen to
    maximize information gain until a set level of separation is reached.  At
    the terminus of the series of splits, called a leaf, a class is assigned.
    The usual parameters that can be set when creating a decision tree are: the
    maximum depth of the tree (how many layers of nodes you will allow), the
    minimum split size (how many data points do you require to keep splitting),
    and minimum leaf size (how small does a leaf have to be before you stop). 
    \begin{figure}[ht]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[angle=0,width=4in]{figures/analysis/protonid/trees_diagram.pdf}
      \caption{Graphical example of a decision tree.}
      \label{fig:dtree}
    \end{figure}
    
    A single tree can easily overfit a data set if it is at all complex, and
    its output is just a class label. Gradient-boosting addresses both of these
    issues by combining many weak classifiers into a strong one. Each weak
    classifier is built based on the error of the previous one. For a given
    training set, whenever a sample is classified incorrectly by a tree, that
    sample is given a higher importance when the next tree is being created.
    Mathematically, each tree is training on the gradient of the loss function.
    After all of the trees have been created, each tree is given a weight based
    on its ability to classify the training set, and the output of the
    gradient-boosted decision tree classifier is the probability that a sample
    is in a given class.
    
    The gradient-boosted decision tree software package we use is
    XGBoost~\cite{Chen:2016btl}. There are two types of classifiers we can use
    to separate protons from other tracks: binary and multiclass. Both
    classifiers are trained on all types of reconstructed tracks. A binary
    classifier classifies each track as either a proton or not a proton, and a
    multiclass classifier classifies a track as one of many types including a
    proton. We choose to use multiclass because the information about
    non-proton tracks is useful for selecting neutral current events. The five
    classes that we train the decision trees to classify are protons (both
    neutrino-induced and cosmic), neutrino-induced muons, neutrino-induced
    pions, neutrino-induced electrons/photons, and all non-proton cosmics.
    
  \subsubsection{Training}
    \begin{table}[ht]
      \caption{Breakdown by simulated particle type reconstructed tracks in the
        training set.
      \label{tab:mctrain}}
      \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ l r r r r r }
        \hline
        & Protons & Muons & Pions & EM Showers & Non-proton Cosmics \\
        \hline
        No. of tracks  & 90,922 & 57,583 & 12,848 & 473,323 & 2,586,527 \\
        Fraction of set & 0.028 & 0.018 & 0.004 & 0.147 & 0.803 \\
        Class weight  & 0.141 & 0.223 & 1.000 & 0.027 & 0.005 \\
        \hline
      \end{tabularx}
    \end{table}

    The gradient-boosted decision tree model was trained on 95,600 events with
    both simulated GENIE neutrino interactions and simulated CORSIKA cosmic
    interactions. Each track in every event was treated as a separate training
    sample. Table~\ref{tab:mctrain} shows the number of each type of track that
    was used for training. There are were a total of 3,221,203 simulated
    training tracks.

    Because the training set has unbalanced classes (there are different
    numbers of each particle type) each training sample is initially weighted
    so that the sum of weights is equal to the size of the smallest class, in
    this case pions.
    \begin{equation*}
      N_s = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{n}}w^n_i \,,
    \end{equation*}
    where $N_s$ is the number of samples in the smallest class, $N_{n}$ is the
    number samples in the $n^{th}$ class, and $w^n_i$ is the weight given to
    the $ith$ sample in that class. The same weight is used for each sample in
    a class, so the value of each positive weight is $w^n=\frac{N_s}{N_{n}}$.
    Balancing the training set prevents the classifier from only learning the
    most frequent classes. In our case, the classifier could achieve a high
    accuracy by classifying everything as a cosmic in the unbalanced set
    because over 80\% of the tracks are cosmic-induced. One of our main goals
    is to have a proton ID efficiency, and since protons only make up 3\% of
    the training set, giving them a higher weight makes it more important to
    the classifier that they are correctly classified.

    The parameters used for training were chosen to both maximize
    classification accuracy and minimize overfitting to the training set.
    Overfitting occurs when the performance on the training set is more
    accurate than the performance on an external test set. The final training
    parameter settings are:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Objective: multiclass: softprob} \\
      The learning objective. We want to classify five different track types
      and get a probability of each class.  
      \item \textbf{Learning rate: 0.045}  \\
      The factor each incorrectly classified sample gets re-weighted by for the
      next tree.  A smaller learning rate requires more trees but prevents
      overfitting.
      \item \textbf{Number of trees: 500} \\
      The total number of trees in classifier.
      \item \textbf{Maximum depth: 10} \\ 
      The maximum number of layers of nodes each tree can have.
      \item \textbf{Maximum sampled features: 0.8} \\
      The fraction of total features that each tree can use to train. These are
      randomly sampled.
      \item \textbf{Maximum sampled observations: 0.85} \\
      The fraction of total samples that each tree can use to train. These are
      randomly sampled.
    \end{itemize}

  \subsubsection{Performance on a Test Set}
    The performance of the gradient-boosted decision tree model was tested on a
    set of 3,200,000 reconstructed tracks from 96,200 events with simulated
    GENIE neutrino interactions and simulated CORSIKA cosmic interactions. This
    set of tracks was generated in the exact same way as the training set.

      scores for simulated proton tracks from NC elastic proton interactions.}
      \label{fig:pidmcoutNCE}
    \end{figure}
    Figure~\ref{fig:pidmcout} shows normalized histograms of the output proton
    score for every track in the test set. The proton score ranges from zero to
    one with zero being the least proton-like and one being the most. The blue
    histogram shows all simulated neutrino-induced and cosmic induced proton
    tracks normalized so that the area under the histogram is one. The orange
    histogram shows every other simulated track type, also normalized so that
    the area under it is equal to one. Figure~\ref{fig:pidmcoutNCE} shows the
    area-normalized histogram of proton scores for simulated proton tracks that
    were produced in neutral current elastic proton events.

      \caption{Heatmap showing the fraction of each class that is made up of a
      given particle type.}
      \label{fig:heatmap}
    \end{figure}
    Figure~\ref{fig:heatmap} shows the overall classification performance of
    the gradient-boosted decision tree model on the test set for each class.
    The x axis shows the true particle type and the y axis shows the particle
    classes. The numbers in the boxes are the fraction of the class that is
    made up of the given true particle type. The fraction of true protons in
    the set of tracks classified as protons is 0.71, the fraction of true muons
    in that set is 0.04, the fraction of true pions is 0.09, the fraction of
    electromagnetic shower particles is 0.04, and the fraction of non-proton
    cosmics in the proton-classified set is 0.05. A track is labelled as a
    given class type in this plot if the particle's decision tree score for
    that class is higher than its score for any of the other four classes.  The
    numbers in this plot were calculated using equal numbers of each true
    particle type. In reality, there are far more non-proton cosmic tracks than
    there are true protons, and the fraction of true protons in the set
    classified as protons will be smaller.

    \end{figure}
    Figure~\ref{fig:pideffke} shows the efficiency of the decision tree proton
    identification on simulated neutrino-induced protons as a function of true
    proton kinetic energy. The left plot (\ref{fig:pideffkeall}) shows the full
    simulated range of true proton kinetic energy, and the right
    (\ref{fig:pideffkerng}) shows the range of interest to this analysis. In
    the interesting range of kinetic energies, the proton identification
    efficiency stays relatively flat between 0.8 and 0.8 efficiency, with an
    average efficiency of 0.71. A track is considered positively identified as
    a proton in these plots if its decision tree proton score is higher than
    0.5, meaning it is more likely than not to be a proton.

        \caption{Efficiency as a function of the cosine of the true proton
          angle from the beam direction.}

      \begin{subfigure}[t]{2.5in}

        \label{fig:pideffanglephi}
      \end{subfigure}
      \caption{The efficiency of simulated neutrino-induced proton tracks
        correctly classified as protons as a function of true proton angle.}
      \label{fig:pideffangle}
    \end{figure}
    Figure~\ref{fig:pideffangle} shows the efficiency of the decision tree proton
    identification on simulated neutrino-induced protons as a function of true
    proton angle. The efficiencies in these plots are calculated using only the
    simulated protons within the kinetic energy range of interest ($0.05$ GeV
    $\le T_p \le 0.5$ GeV) used in Figure~\ref{fig:pideffkerng}. The left plot
    (\ref{fig:pideffangletheta}) shows the efficiency as a function of
    $\cos(\theta_p)$, where $\theta_p$ is the angle of the proton from the
    neutrino beam direction. At $\cos(theta_p) = 1$ the proton is parallel to
    the beam, at $\cos(\theta_p) = -1$ the proton is anti-parallel to the beam,
    and at $\cos(\theta_p) = 0$ the proton is perpendicular to the beam. When
    the proton is perpendicular to the beam, it is aligned with the anode
    collection plane, and will not traverse more than one collection plane
    wire. A large contribution to the decrease in efficiency at $\cos(\theta_p)
    = 0$ is the fact that the decision tree classifier only uses calorimetry
    information from the collection plane. The right
    plot(\ref{fig:pideffanglephi}) shows the efficiency as a function of
    $\phi_p$ which is the angle around the neutrino beam direction. The flat
    efficiency is due to the fact that the neutrino-induced proton angle should
    be isotropic in $\phi_p$, and the angle around the beam direction has no
    effect on the angle with respect to the angle of the anode wires. Again, a
    track is considered positively identified as a proton in these plots if its
    decision tree proton score is higher than 0.5.

      versus true proton kinetic energy.}
      \label{fig:pideffthetake}
    \end{figure}
    Figure~\ref{fig:pideffthetake} shows the two-dimensional efficiency for
    true proton $\cos(\theta_p)$ versus true proton kinetic energy. The kinetic
    energy range of interest to this analysis goes up to $0.5$ GeV (the bottom
    half of the plot).

  \subsubsection{Performance on a Neutrino Data Subset}
    The gradient-boosted decision tree classifier was tested on a subset of
    MicroBooNE neutrino data corresponding to 5e19 POT ($< 5\%$ of the full
    MicroBooNE approved POT). The data subset comes entirely from MicroBooNE's
    first year of running (Run I).
    
    Figures~\ref{fig:pidnhits}-\ref{fig:pidphi} show comparisons between the
    subset of MicroBooNE neutrino data and the MicroBooNE simulation for each
    of the input variables being used in the decision tree classifier. A
    description of each of these reconstructed track features is given in
    Sec.~\ref{sec:features}. The left plots show the histogram of the given
    variable for all tracks being input to the classifier, and the right plots
    show the histograms of the given variable for the tracks that were
    classified as protons. A track is considered classified as a proton if the
    decision tree proton score is greater than 0.5 for that track.
    
    In all of the figures, the black points in the top plots show the subset of
    neutrino data.  The horizontal bars represent the bin width, and the
    vertical bars represent the statistical uncertainty. The light gray filled
    histogram includes tracks from the off-beam data. These tracks represent
    the background of events where a cosmic interaction in the detector
    coincident with the beam time window triggered the event, and there was no
    actual neutrino interaction. The dark gray filled histograms include cosmic
    tracks that are in the background of events with actual neutrino
    interactions that triggered the event. For simulated neutrino interactions
    inside the detector, real data cosmic tracks are overlaid on the simulated
    event, and for simulated neutrino interaction outside the detector, the
    background cosmic tracks are from simulation. The color filled histograms
    include tracks from simulated neutrino interactions. The peach colored
    histograms include simulated neutrino-induced proton tracks, the dark green
    includes simulated neutrino-induced pion tracks, the light green includes
    simulated neutrino-induced muon tracks, and the purple includes simulated
    neutrino-induced electromagnetic shower tracks. The fraction of proton
    tracks in the right plots (the tracks classified as protons) is much larger
    than in the left plots (all tracks), which is the goal of the classifier.
    The bottom plots in all of the figures show the ratio of the neutrino data
    points to the sum of all of the stacked, filled histograms. A ratio of one
    means perfect data to simulation agreement.

\subsection{Efficiency and Background Estimation}\label{sec:effbg}
  \subsubsection{Event selection efficiency}
    Efficiency due to TPC, PMT software trigger, reconstruction, proton ID,
    event selection, etc. This includes efficiency due to proton reinteracting
    in the nucleus and other nuclear effects.
  \subsubsection{Beam Induced Dirt Background}
    Discuss dirt neutrons, how they happen and estimated rates and energy
    distributions.  Show how well we can seperate or understand them. Show any
    sort of data-driven correction we did to dirt neutron background and how it
    affects our uncertainty. Talk about how well we can tag cryostat neutrons
    with the PMTs.
  \subsubsection{Beam Induced TPC Background}
    Talk about neutral-current elastic neutrons that are produced in the TPC
    and how their distributions differ from NCEp ones. Also include BNB
    backgounds (CCQE where muon wasn't reconstructed, NCpi0, etc.) Discuss how
    the optical signal would be different for each of these.
  \subsubsection{Cosmic Background}
    Discuss the difference between cosmic tracks and beam proton tracks. How do
    we separate them? What is the rate?

\subsection{Ratio of NCEp to CCQEn Cross Sections}\label{sec:ratios}
  Show how the ratio gets rid of a lot of measurement uncertainty like beam
  flux and efficiencies. Give exact equation that we will be using for
  analysis. Show how $\Delta s$ is still large at low $Q^2$.
  \subsubsection{Sources of Measurement Uncertainty}
    TPC efficiency: If ionization electrons actually reach the
    TPC and leave a signal.
    PMT trigger efficiency: Refer back to PMT trigger studies. Give uncertainty
    due to on signal.
    Reconstruction efficiency: Refer back. Give uncertainty on signal.
  \subsubsection{Quantifying Uncertainty on Ratio}\label{errorcalc}
    Calculate exact uncertainty and show it here.
  \subsubsection{Model uncertainty}\label{sec:modeluncertainty}
    Nuclear effects and FSI. Discuss. Discuss which values are varied and by
    how much? Refer to reweighting section.
