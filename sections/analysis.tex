% Particle Identification and Event Selection
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Particle Identification and Event Selection}
  Classification goals (cosmic rejection and neutrino-induced particle type).
  \subsubsection{Reconstructed track features}
    Itemize and discuss every feature used as inuot to classifier.
    Separate into cosmic rejection and particle ID.
  \subsubsection{Boosted decision trees}
    Decision trees, tree boosting, xgboost.
  \subsubsection{Performance}
    Show efficiency, accuracy, itemize backgrounds.
    Discuss reasons for different backgrounds.
  \subsection{Event selection}
    Need to select both NCE and CCQE events.
    Use particle ID plus reconstructed flashes.
    Exactly how we select NCE events 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Efficiency and Background Estimation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Efficiency and Background Estimation}\label{background}
  \subsubsection{Event selection efficiency}
    Efficiency due to TPC, PMT software trigger, reconstruction, proton ID,
    event selection, etc. This includes efficiency due to proton reinteracting
    in the nucleus and other nuclear effects.
  \subsubsection{Beam Induced Dirt Background}
    Discuss dirt neutrons, how they happen and estimated rates and energy
    distributions.  Show how well we can seperate or understand them. Show any
    sort of data-driven correction we did to dirt neutron background and how it
    affects our uncertainty. Talk about how well we can tag cryostat neutrons
    with the PMTs.
  \subsubsection{Beam Induced TPC Background}
    Talk about neutral-current elastic neutrons that are produced in the TPC
    and how their distributions differ from NCEp ones. Also include BNB
    backgounds (CCQE where muon wasn't reconstructed, NCpi0, etc.) Discuss how
    the optical signal would be different for each of these.
  \subsubsection{Cosmic Background}
    Discuss the difference between cosmic tracks and beam proton tracks. How do
    we separate them? What is the rate?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Ratio of Cross Sections
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Ratio of NCEp to CCQEn Cross Sections}\label{ratios}
  Show how the ratio gets rid of a lot of measurement uncertainty like beam
  flux and efficiencies. Give exact equation that we will be using for
  analysis. Show how $\Delta s$ is still large at low $Q^2$.
  \subsubsection{Sources of Measurement Uncertainty}
    TPC efficiency: If ionization electrons actually reach the
    TPC and leave a signal.
    PMT trigger efficiency: Refer back to PMT trigger studies. Give uncertainty due to on signal.
    Reconstruction efficiency: Refer back. Give uncertainty on signal.
  \subsubsection{Quantifying Uncertainty on Ratio}\label{errorcalc}
    Calculate exact uncertainty and show it here.
  \subsubsection{}
    Nuclear effects and FSI. Discuss 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Comparison to Simulation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Joint Estimation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Joint Estimation of $M_A$ and $\Delta s$}\label{deltas}
  Here is where we do the actual MCMC.
  \subsubsection{Probability of $\theta$ given D}
    Walk through the Bayesian math. Start with wanting the probability of
    $\theta$ given the data and the model and get final equation. Then show how
    to combine with previous experiments. Should give detail for each factor in
    equation (prior, likelihood, posterior, evidence). Should especially give
    detail on how we choose priors. Maybe talk about model selection when
    talking about the evidence.
  \subsubsection{Markov Chain Monte Carlo}
    Go through detail on our implementation of MCMC. Discuss how Markov Chains
    work in general. Then describe affine invariance and parallel tempering.
    Explain that parallel tempering would allow us to do model selection.
  \subsubsection{Results}
    Lots of plots! $\Delta s$!
