\subsection{The Spin Structure of Nucleons}
  Proton spin: \\
  --- spin vector s\_mu from forward matrix element of axial vector current \\
  --- derive axial charges \\
  --- expectation of axial charges from non-relativistic quark model
  --- scaling and Regge theory?
  \subsubsection{Proton spin puzzle}
    --- parton model \\
    --- spin structure functions (g1 and g2) \\
    --- spin sum rules: Bjorken and Ellis-Jaffe \\
  \subsubsection{Nucleon Form Factors}
    Talk about how to parameterize the nucleon in terms of the form factors
    Discuss Dirac, Pauli, electric, and magnetic.
  \subsubsection{The Axial Form Factor}
    Derive the axial form factor. Discuss different axial form factor models
    (dipole...). Show that you can determine $\Delta s$. Make explicit that
    this is the same $\Delta s$ from first subsubsection.

\subsection{Neutrino Cross Sections}\label{probe}
  \subsubsection{Electroweak Interactions}
    Go from electroweak lagrangean to weak current matrix elements to actual
    cross sections. Show both neutral-current and charged-current version of
    elastic scattering cross section.
  \subsubsection{Weak interactions and the Axial Form Factor}
    Why are neutrinos better probes than electrons or photons?
