\subsection{The Spin Structure of Nucleons} \label{sec:nuctheory}
  Proton spin: \\
  --- spin vector $s_{\mu}$ from forward matrix element of axial vector current \\
  --- derive axial charges \\
  From Bass 1.1 (need to fill in with Peskin): \\
  Forward matrix element of the axial current vector (derive from peskin):
  \[
      2Ms_{\mu} = <p,s|\bar{\psi}\gamma_{\mu} \gamma_{5} \psi|p,s>
  \]
  where $s_{\mu}$ is the proton's spin vector, $\psi$ is the proton field
  vector and $M$ is the proton mass. The quark axial charges measure
  information about the quark ``spin content".
  \[
    2Ms_{\mu}\Delta q = <p,s| \bar{q}\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}q|p,s> \,,
  \]
  where $q$ is the quark field operator and $\Delta q$ is the quark
  flavor-dependent axial charge, $\Delta u$, $\Delta d$, or $\Delta s$. The
  isovector, SU(3) octet, and flavor-singlet axial charges, $g_A^{(3)}$,
  $g_A^{(8)}$, and $g_A^{(0)}$, respectively, can be written as linear
  combinations of the quark axial charges (derive from Peskin)
  \begin{align}
      g_A^{(3)} &= \Delta u - \Delta d \\
      g_A^{(8)} &= \Delta u + \Delta d - 2\Delta s \\
      g_A^{(0)} &= \Delta u + \Delta d + \Delta s \,.
  \end{align}
  Can be interpreted semi-classically as amount of spin carried by quarks and
  antiquarks of flavor $q$.

    Talk about how to parameterize the nucleon in terms of the form factors
    Discuss Dirac, Pauli, electric, and magnetic.

    From Thomas, we derive elastic lepton-nucleon scattering starting with
    conservation of energy and momentum. \\
    Section 2.1: \\
    Elastic scattering means that the nucleon remains in it's ground state so
    that the energy transfer is
    \[
        \nu = \epsilon - \epsilon' = E' - E,
     \]
    where $\epsilon$ is energy of incident electron, E is energy of the nucleon.
    Also, three-momentum transfer is
    \[
        \bar{q} = \bar{p} - \bar{p}' = \bar{P}' - \bar{P} \,.
    \]
    So, squared four-momentum is
    \[
        q^2 = \nu^2 - \bar{q}^2 = -Q^2 < 0
    \]
    which is Lorentz invariant.
    From energy and momentum conservation, we get
    \[
        \epsilon' = \frac{\epsilon}{1+\frac{2\epsilon}{M}\mathrm{sin}^2\frac{\theta}{2}}
    \]
    and
    \[
        Q^2 = 4\epsilon \epsilon' \mathrm{sin}^2 \frac{\theta}{2} \,.
    \]
    This leads to the Mott differential cross section (pointlike, spinless)
    \[
        \left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} \right)_\textrm{Mott} = \frac{\alpha^2}{4\epsilon^2 \textrm{sin}^4\frac{\theta}{2}}\frac{\epsilon'}{\epsilon}\textrm{cos}^2\frac{\theta}{2} \,.
    \]
    If we make it spin 1/2 with a normal (Dirac) magnetic moment (still pointlike), we get an additional term (increases backwards angles):
    \[
        \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} \right)_\textrm{Mott} \left[ 1 + \frac{Q^2}{4M^2}2\mathrm{tan}^2\frac{\theta}{2} \right] \,.
    \]
    Now we just need to add finite structure and anomolous magnetic moment,
    \[
        \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} \right)_\textrm{Mott} 
        \left(F_1^2(Q^2) +\frac{Q^2}{4M}\left[F_2^2(Q^2)+2(F_1(Q^2)+F_2(Q^2))^2\,\textrm{tan}^2\frac{\theta}{2} \right] \right) \,.
    \]
    The Dirac and Pauli form factors, $F_1$ and $F_2$ respectively, can be parameterized as the electric and magnetic, or Sachs, form factors
    \begin{align}
        G_E(Q^2) &= F_1(Q^2) - \frac{Q^2}{4M}F_2(Q^2) \\
        G_M(Q^2) &= F_1(Q^2) + F_2(Q^2) \,.
    \end{align}
    Low $Q^2$ data. Sachs form factors when $Q^2$ goes to zero. Three dimensional fourier integral and slopes go to mean squared radii.

  \subsubsection{The Axial Form Factor}
    Derive the axial form factor. Discuss different axial form factor models
    (dipole...). Show that you can determine $\Delta s$. Make explicit that
    this is the same $\Delta s$ from first subsubsection.

\subsection{Neutrino Cross Sections}\label{sec:probe}
  \subsubsection{Weak interactions and the Axial Form Factor}
    Why are neutrinos better probes than electrons or photons?
  \subsubsection{Electroweak Interactions}
    Go from electroweak lagrangean to weak current matrix elements to actual
    cross sections. Show both neutral-current and charged-current version of
    elastic scattering cross section.

  %%% starting text %%%
  From Alberico, starting with 2.3: \\
  The NC lagrangean is (interaction of leptons and quarks with $Z^0$:
  \[
      \mathcal{L}^{NC} = -\frac{g}{2\textrm{cos}\theta_W}j_{\alpha}^{NC}Z^{\alpha},
  \]
  where $j_{\alpha}^{NC}$ is \textit{the} neutral current. Since unification of
  weak and electromagnetic is required, we get
  \[
    j_{\alpha}^{NC} = 2j_{\alpha}^3 - 2\textrm{sin}^2\theta_W j_{\alpha}^{em},
  \]
  where $j_{\alpha}^{em}$ is electromagnetic current and $j_{\alpha}^3$ is some
  sort of isovector component?
  \[
      j_{\alpha}^{em} = \sum_{l = e,\mu,\tau} (-1)\bar{l}\gamma_{\alpha}l + \sum_{q=u,d,...}e_q\bar{q}\gamma_{\alpha}q
  \]
  and
  \[
    j_{\alpha}^i = \sum_a \bar{\psi}_{aL} \gamma_{\alpha}\frac{1}{2} \tau^i \psi_{aL} \,,
  \]
  and $\psi_{aL} = \frac{1}{2}(1-\gamma_5)\psi_a$ are the left-handed doublets
  of the SU(2)xU(1) gauge group of the standard model, and I don't know what $\tau$ is.
  So, we get
  \begin{align*}
      j_{\alpha}^{NC} &= \sum_{q=u,c,t}\bar{q}\gamma_{\alpha}(1-\gamma_5)\frac{1}{2}q
                       + \sum_{q=d,s,b}\bar{q}\gamma_{\alpha}(1-\gamma_5)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)q \\
                      &+ \sum_{l=e,\mu,\tau}\bar{\nu_l}\gamma_{\alpha}(1-\gamma_5)\frac{1}{2}\nu_l
                       + \sum_{l=e,\mu,\tau}\bar{l}\gamma_{\alpha}(1-\gamma_5)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)l \\
                      &- 2\mathrm{sin}^2\theta_W j_{\alpha}^{em} \,.
  \end{align*}
  It's convenient to separate the contributions from the light ($u,d$) and
  heavy ($s,c,...$) quarks. We get
  \[
    \j_{\alpha}^{NC;q} = v_{\alpha}^3 - a_{\alpha}^3 - \frac{1}{2}(v_{\alpha}^s - a_{\alpha}^s) - 2\mathrm{sin}^2\theta_W j_{\alpha}^{em} \,,
  \]
  where we define
  \begin{align*}
      v_{\alpha}^3 &= \bar{u}\gamma_{\alpha}\frac{1}{2}u - \bar{d}\gamma_{\alpha}\frac{1}{2}d \equiv \bar{N} \gamma_{\alpha}\frac{1}{2}\tau_3 N \\
      a_{\alpha}^3 &= \bar{u}\gamma_{\alpha}\gamma_5\frac{1}{2}u - \bar{d}\gamma_{\alpha}\gamma_5\frac{1}{2}d \equiv \bar{N} \gamma_{\alpha}\gamma_5\frac{1}{2}\tau_3 N \,.
  \end{align*}
  where $N = \left(\begin{matrix}{u}\\{d}\end{matrix} \right)$ is the isotopic
  SU(2) group doublet and the currents $v_{\alpha}^3$ and $a_{\alpha}^3$
  are the third components of the isovectors
  \begin{align*}
      v_{\alpha}^i &= \bar{N} \gamma_{\alpha}\frac{1}{2}\tau^i N \\
      a_{\alpha}^i &= \bar{N} \gamma_{\alpha}\gamma_5\frac{1}{2}\tau^i N \,.
  \end{align*}
  On the other hand, $v_{\alpha}^s$ and $a_{\alpha}^s$ are isoscalars. They
  represent the heavier quark contirbution to $j_{\alpha}^{NC;q}$. If we only
  include the strange quark, we have
  \begin{align*}
      v_{\alpha}^s &= \bar{s}\gamma_{\alpha}s \\
      a_{\alpha}^s &= \bar{s}\gamma_{\alpha}\gamma_5 s \,.
  \end{align*}
  The quark part of the electromagnetic current is
  \[
    j_{\alpha}^{em;q} = \sum_{q=u,d,...} e_q\bar{q} \gamma_{\alpha}q \,,
  \]
  which we can also separate between light and heavy contributions
  \[
    j_{\alpha}^{em;q} = v_{\alpha}^3 + v_{\alpha}^0 \,.
  \]
  where $v_{\alpha}^0$ is the isoscalar current which is given by
  \[
    v_{\alpha}^0 = \frac{1}{6}\bar{N}\gamma_{\alpha}N + \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)\bar{s}\gamma_{\alpha}s \,,
  \]
  if we ignore charm and up.

  Time for one-nucleon matrix elements!
