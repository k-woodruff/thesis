\subsection{The Standard Model}\label{sec:standardmodel}
  Describe the standard model elementary particles --- quarks, leptons, bosons.

  \subsubsection{Nucleons in the Standard model}
    General introduction to nucleons being made of quarks. Explain valance quarks
    and virtual sea quarks with gluons.  Talk about quark model and strong force.

  \subsubsection{Neutrinos in the Standard Model}
    Maybe a short introduction on discovery of neutrinos?
    Introduction to what neutrinos are. Talk generally about forces and the
    weak force.  Handedness and chirality. CKM Matrix.

\subsection{Outside of the Standard Model}\label{sec:bsm}

  \subsubsection{Neutrino Oscillations and Mass}
  Not in the standard model. Quick summary and this is why MicroBooNE exists.

  \subsubsection{Nucleon Spin}\label{sec:nucleonbsm}
  Talk about EMC and proton spin crisis. The spins of the quarks don't add up
  to the total proton spin! Explain what $\Delta s$ is and previous
  measurements.
  Not disallowed by the standard model, just not included.
