% Neutrinos
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Neutrinos}\label{nutheory}
  Maybe a short introduction on discovery of neutrinos?
  \subsubsection{Neutrinos in the Standard Model}
    Introduction to what neutrinos are. Talk about standard model and leptons.
    Maybe talk about mass and oscillations? Talk generally about forces and the
    weak force.
  \subsubsection{Electroweak Interactions}
    Show electroweak Langrangean. Handedness and chirality. CKM Matrix.

\subsection{Nucleon Structure}\label{nucleon}
  General introduction to nucleons being made of quarks. Explain valance quarks
  and virtual sea quarks with gluons.
  \subsubsection{Nucleons in the Standard Model}
    Talk about quark model and strong force.
  \subsubsection{Proton Spin Crisis}
    Talk about EMC and proton spin crisis. 
  \subsubsection{$\Delta s$}
    Explain what $\Delta s$ is and previous measurements.
