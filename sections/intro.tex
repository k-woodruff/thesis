\subsection{The Spin Structure of Nucleons} \label{sec:nuctheory}
  Proton spin: \\
  --- spin vector $s_{\mu}$ from forward matrix element of axial vector current \\
  --- derive axial charges \\
  From Bass 1.1 (need to fill in with Peskin): \\
  Forward matrix element of the axial current vector (derive from peskin):
  \[
      2Ms_{\mu} = <p,s|\bar{\psi}\gamma_{\mu} \gamma_{5} \psi|p,s>
  \]
  where $s_{\mu}$ is the proton's spin vector, $\psi$ is the proton field
  vector and $M$ is the proton mass. The quark axial charges measure
  information about the quark ``spin content".
  \[
    2Ms_{\mu}\Delta q = <p,s| \bar{q}\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}q|p,s> \,,
  \]
  where $q$ is the quark field operator and $\Delta q$ is the quark
  flavor-dependent axial charge, $\Delta u$, $\Delta d$, or $\Delta s$. The
  isovector, SU(3) octet, and flavor-singlet axial charges, $g_A^{(3)}$,
  $g_A^{(8)}$, and $g_A^{(0)}$, respectively, can be written as linear
  combinations of the quark axial charges (derive from Peskin)
  \begin{align}
      g_A^{(3)} &= \Delta u - \Delta d \\
      g_A^{(8)} &= \Delta u + \Delta d - 2\Delta s \\
      g_A^{(0)} &= \Delta u + \Delta d + \Delta s \,.
  \end{align}
  Can be interpreted semi-classically as amount of spin carried by quarks and
  antiquarks of flavor $q$.

  Talk about EMC and proton spin puzzle. The spins of the quarks don't add up
  to the total proton spin! Explain what $\Delta s$ is and previous
  measurements. Talk about structure functions, inclusive DIS, SIDIS...

\subsection{Neutrinos as a Nucleon Probe}\label{sec:neutrinos}

  Neutrinos only interact via the weak force, don't have electromagnetic
  interactions, axial form factor enhanced

  \subsection{Previous NC Elastic Neutrino-Nucleon Measurements}
  \label{sec:measurements}
    Two previous neutrino experiments have performed a measurement of $\Delta
    s$ through neutral current elastic neutrino-nucleon scattering. The first
    was the E734 experiment~\cite{E734nce} at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) in
    1987, and the second was the MiniBooNE experiment~\cite{MiniBooNEnce} at
    Fermilab in 2010.

    \subsubsection{The BNL E734 Experiment}\label{sec:e734}
    The main target and detector of the E734 experiment was 170~tons and was
    made of a combination of liquid scintillator cells and proportional drift
    tubes (PDTs). The liquid scintillator composed 80\% of the target and was
    used for calorimetry and timing, while the PDTs were used for position
    information. Additionally, there was a electromagnetic shower counter and a
    muon specotrometer just downstream of the main detector. The full detector
    schematic is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:e734detector}.
