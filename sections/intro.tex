\subsection{Nucleons}\label{nucleonintro}
  \subsubsection{Nucleons in the Standard model}
  General introduction to nucleons being made of quarks. Explain valance quarks
  and virtual sea quarks with gluons.  Talk about quark model and strong force.
  \subsubsection{Nucleon Spin}
  Talk about EMC and proton spin crisis.  Explain what $\Delta s$ is and
  previous measurements.

\subsection{Neutrinos}\label{neutrinointro}
  Maybe a short introduction on discovery of neutrinos?
  \subsubsection{Neutrinos in the Standard Model}
    Introduction to what neutrinos are. Talk generally about forces and the
    weak force.  Handedness and chirality. CKM Matrix.
  \subsubsection{Neutrino Oscillations and Mass}
