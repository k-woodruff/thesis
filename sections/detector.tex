% Neutrino Beam
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Booster Neutrino Beam}\label{beam}
  \subsubsection{Protons}
    Write about where the protons come from, how they get accelerated, and what
    their final energy distribution is. Also write about bunch and spill
    structure.
  \subsubsection{Target and Horn}
    Write about target, mesons that are created, how they're focused, and what
    the decay chain is with how many of each particle is created. 
  \subsubsection{Neutrino Flux at MicroBooNE}
    Write about how neutrinos go through dirt to experiments. Explain all the
    details of neutrino beam at MicroBooNE including total flux, energy shape,
    timing structure, expected number of events (both for total numu ints and
        for NCEp).

% MicroBooNE LArTPC and PMTs
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{MicroBooNE LArTPC and PMTs}\label{tpc}
  \subsubsection{LArTPCs}
    Explain LArTPCs in general: how argon ionizes and electrons drift through
    electric field. Also explain why liquid argon is used as opposed to another
    liquid.
  \subsubsection{MicroBooNE TPC}
    Give MicroBooNE specs including dimensions, number of wires, electric
    field, drift speed, etc.
  \subsubsection{MicroBooNE PMT System}
    Write about how argon also scintillates and that can be used for timing
    cosmic rejection.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% DAQ and Trigger
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Data Acquisition and Trigger}\label{daq}
  \subsubsection{TPC Readout Electronics}
    Describe cold electronics (front end ASIC preamplifies and shapes), warm
    interface electronics (intermediate amplifier for transmission over 20 m.
        long cable), and digitizing electronics (TPC readout board in crate
          continuously samples received signals and passing from ADC to FPGA
          for processing, reducing, and storage). Maybe also talk about cabling
        and signal feedthrough. Also discuss specs like sampling rate.
  \subsubsection{PMT Readout Electronics and Trigger}
    Consist of signal shaper boards, an FEM modified from TPC version, PMT
    feedthrough, HV/signal splitters, and a trigger board. Write about optical
    flash reconstruction.
  \subsubsection{DAQ System}
    Receives and buffers data from TPC and PMT readout system, then builds and
    records event based on trigger decision. Write about SEBs and EVB and
    passing data between. Should go into detail here about trigger algorithm.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Simulation and Reconstruction
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Simulation and Reconstruction}\label{reco}
  \subsubsection{Simulation}
    Describe all 3 stages of simulations: Genie (generation), Geant4
    (propogation), and detector simulation.
  \subsubsection{Noise Filters and Hits}
    Write about filtering raw signal and hit finding algorithm used (gaushit?).
    I think give efficiencies at this stage.
  \subsubsection{Clusters and Tracks}
    Explain how hits are clustered and then combined into tracks or showers.
    Explain algorithm used and give efficiencies at this stage. Also include
    cosmic tagging and calorimetry.
  \subsubsection{Particle Identification}
    Explain BDTs (if used) and how well they do at separating protons from
    different backgrounds.
